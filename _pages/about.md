# About Katzenjammer

 Katzenjammer is a one-of-a-kind card game that blends the excitement of Uno, Truth or Dare, and Yu-Gi-Oh. The game is played with decks of cards that contain dares and action cards, with a unique twist - the dares are created by the players themselves.


## How it works

The goal of Katzenjammer is to get other players to perform dares while minimizing the number of dares you have to perform yourself.

To start, players are dealt cards from a **Dare Deck**. Each card corresponds to a dare, the severity of which is indicated by its color. However, the players don't know what dare is on each card is until they use a custom mobile app with Augmented Reality to reveal it. In each round of gameplay, players try to get rid of cards by betting them. Players place the cards they want to get rid of from their hand onto the table. After bets are locked in, a card is pulled from the **Action Deck**, resulting in a player getting rid of cards they bet, drawing more cards, or performing the dares on the cards they bet. Rounds are played until all dares have been performed or the **STOP** card is pulled from the **Action Deck**.

What sets Katzenjammer apart is that the dares on the cards are input by the players using a companion app. This means that the stakes are as high as your friends' respect for your dignity allows, and the embarrassment factor is off the charts. The companion app also has the ability to create or load multiple **Dare Decks**. This ensures the game never gets stale, and it can adapt to different playing scenarios. For example, you could have a **Dare Deck** for a relaxing Friday night with friends or one specifically tailored to a camping trip, with dares that take into account the outdoor environment.

Within the **Dare Deck** there are also **Monster Cards** that can be used throughout the game to sabotage opponents or protect players from the consequences of certain dares. The game ends when the draw deck is empty, and players must perform the dares on the cards left in their hand.

Katzenjammer is a hilarious and interactive card game that will have you and your friends laughing, cringing, and having a great time. Get ready for the ultimate player-driven game night!
