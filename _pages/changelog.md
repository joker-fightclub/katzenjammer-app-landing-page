What a bustling summer we've had! We thoroughly enjoyed attending various conventions, including Game Con Canada in June. The feedback we've received about our game has been invaluable. We're eager to reach out to our email subscribers soon to recruit beta testers.

Holy cow! A year has flown by since the last update. We are happy to share that some very important features for the app are finally working. The ability to record and share dares filmed using the app now works without having to use your smartphones screen record function. We have also added some some quality of life improvements for generating new decks.
<br>
We are also excited to announce that we will be participating at GOBfest 2023 in Edmonton this March as part of the protoype alley! More info here: https://www.gobfest.ca/
